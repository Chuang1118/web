# The Menger Lab

Our team was the first in Europe to establish CRISPR-Cas9 screening in vivo in primary T cells, developing a functional pipeline for the unbiased and systematic characterization of T cell limiting factors in complex immunosuppressive environments. The team now integrates additional developments in synthetic biology using genome-wide CRISPR activation modification, editing of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, CAR combinatorial therapies and modulating epigenetic regulators of the antitumor immune response in vivo.

Laurie is an INSERM researcher and young group leader of the Advanced-T cell therapy team (U1015) at Gustave Roussy (GR), specialized in Onco/Immunobiotechnology. She has built her career on the use of multidisciplinary approaches to conduct immunotherapeutic projects leading to translational development. In 2019, she obtained financial support from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche Jeune chercheur (ANRJCJC) Grant and in 2021 received an ATIP-Avenir (starting package, INSERM) and Gustave Roussy starting package. Her research is also feeding 2 Flagship medico-scientific programs, the precision medicine program (PRISM) and the Innovative Therapeutics emerging program.

Our work focuses on the study of T cells biology in immunosuppressive environments through systematic and unbiased approaches to accelerate immunotherapeutic targets discovery. Our goal is to characterize the genes and essential parameters for the development of synthetic immunology providing a new class of effective, safe and affordable treatments for oncology.
