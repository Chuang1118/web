Aurelien Sutra Del Galy, MD, PhD, is a physician specializing in hematology and bone marrow transplantation. He trained in Gerard Socié’s team at Saint Louis Hospital in Paris. Leveraging his bioinformatics expertise, he contributed to the discovery of SOCS1 as a critical internal checkpoint inhibitor of CD4 T cells. He also played a role in elucidating the function of FAS in preventing the rejection of allogeneic CAR T cells. For his PhD at the Curie Institute, supervised by Sebastian Amigorena, he studied how alternative splice junctions and transposable elements can lead to tumor-specific neopeptides, which may serve as targets for cellular and antibody-based therapies.
