Chuang has always enjoyed working at the interface of three disciplines: Biology, Informatics and Mathematics. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and Molecular biology and a Master's Degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. His Master's Degree trained him to access engineering positions in bioinformatics. Previously, He has worked at the National Center of Human Genomics Research as a bioinformatician in the Laboratory for Epigenetics and Environment under the supervision of Dr. Jörg Tost dates 2017-2018. Since 2019, he joined Pierre Milpied's team at the Marseille Luminy Immunology Center (CIML) as a bioinformatics engineer. His work focused on the analysis of single cell and spatial transcriptomics to characterize three axes of B cell biology: Germinal Center biology, Lymphomas and Tumor-infiltrating B cells. At the beginning of 2025, he joined our team as a bioinformatics specialist to develop a project "Epigenetic and epitranscritomic regulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and CAR-T cells". His work aims at 1/ exploring the therapeutic potential of agents and genome editing in cell therapy and 2/providing proof of concept for targeting these factors ex vivo using omics data.
