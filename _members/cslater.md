Chloe Slater is a PhD candidate in Cancer Biology conducting her research jointly at Harvard University/ Massachusetts General Hospital and Gustave Roussy/Universit√© Paris-Saclay. Her work focuses on understanding mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in mutant IDH-driven cancers, with a particular interest in cholangiocarcinoma and glioma. She investigates the neoplastic cell-autonomous and immune cell-paracrine roles in tumorigenesis and immune evasion, utilizing genetically engineered mouse models, T-cell engineering, and genome-wide CRISPR screens to uncover novel pathways influencing therapeutic resistance.
Prior to academic research, Chloe spent 8 years in industry research. During this time her work spanned early immuno-oncology target discovery, mechanistic validation, and drug discovery as well as the development of cell-based assays and biomarker strategies. Chloe earned her Bachelor of Science in Biology from Northeastern University.
